        <h1>Welcome to the Cerfified Cosmos Moments™ website.</h1>
        <p>In this page, you'll learn:</p>
        <b>1. </b>What Certified Cosmos Moments™ are.<p></p>
        <b>2. </b>How to avoid them.<p></p>
        <b>3. </b>How the fuck up your code.<p></p>

        <h2>What are Certified Cosmos Moments™?</h2>
        <p>A Certified Cosmos Moment™ is where Cosmos makes your code not do what it's supposed to in a funky way, for example: Drawing straight lines with VBE, which draws points with the airbrush utility in MS Paint.</p>

        <h2>How can you avoid them?</h2>
        <p>You can't. Cosmos is very nice and makes you suffer in pain having to rewrite your whole codebase to work with Cosmos.</p>

        <h2>How do they fuck up my code?</h2>
        <p>Certified Cosmos Moments™ fuck up your code in ways that you'll have to rewrite everything, for example, the VBE driver, it's shit, so you'll have to make one yourself because the one Cosmos has is broken. Very nice huh?</p>
